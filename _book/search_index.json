["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction The package bookdown(Xie 2019a) was built on knitr(Xie 2019b). It aims to complement Pandoc in the following aspects: automatic numbering of figures and tables in the HTML output; cross-references of figures and tables; fine control of the appearance of figures and to make it easy to produce books looking visually pleasant. To get started, the author provides a demo bookdown-demo on Github:demo. For RStudio, we can directly get this demo by creating a new R project(it may need to install the package bookdown first). This demo provides a good template to begin on. After this notes, I hope we are able to custom the demo as we want. A bookdown book is built on several .Rmd files(encoding in UTF-8), with each starting the charpter title with # Charpter Title. By default,bookdown merges all Rmd files by the order of filenames ( that is why in the provided demo, the filenames are ordered). In addition, index.Rmd(if exists) will always be treated as the first and filenames starting with _ are skipped. All these can be overided in _bookdown.yml by adding rmd_files : [&quot;index.Rmd&quot;, &quot;abstract.Rmd&quot;, &quot;intro.Rmd&quot;] References "]
